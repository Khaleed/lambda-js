# lambda-js
![This is a logo of functional JS](http://bit.ly/2mJ4BGb)

## Goal

- Create annotated code and examples of how to write a more functional JavaScript in ES6.
- Where possible, examples will be compared to non-functional programming code.

## Instructions

### Dependencies

To get dependencies

`npm install`

To run the code, run node on any of the source files that are under the `src` directory

`node curry.js`

## Credits

- Thanks to Sal Becker who was the first person to teach me about Map, Reduce, and Filter at RC. 
- Special thanks to Professor [Ragde](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/) of the University of Waterloo for sharing his insights into Functional Programming during his residency at RC.
